            <p className="text-justify mt-4 text-gray-700">
              Our mission is to make car buying and selling more transparent and
              accessible for everyone. Whether you are looking to sell your car
              or purchase one, our platform provides reliable price predictions
              that reflect the true market value. We focus on offering users the
              ability to quickly and easily determine the fair price of a
              vehicle based on essential details such as make, model, year, and
              more.

              What We Do
            </span>
            <p className="text-justify mt-4 text-gray-700">
              We leverage a robust machine learning model trained on a
              comprehensive dataset of over 426,000 used cars from the U.S.
              market. By analyzing key features such as mileage, manufacturer,
              condition, fuel type, and transmission, our platform generates an
              accurate price estimate that helps users make informed decisions.

              Our Technology
            </span>
            <p className="text-justify mt-4 text-gray-700">
              We use sophisticated machine learning algorithms such as Random
              Forest and XGBoost to deliver high predictive accuracy. These
              models are selected for their ability to handle complex data and
              provide insights into which factors most impact car prices. With
              built-in mechanisms to prevent overfitting, we ensure that our
              price estimates remain reliable across various car types and
              conditions.

              In the future, we aim to expand our platform to support the Sri
              Lankan car market and fine-tune our model to enhance prediction
              accuracy. Our ongoing improvements will continue to make the
